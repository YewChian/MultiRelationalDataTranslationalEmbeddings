# MultiRelationalDataTranslationalEmbeddings
## Modelling multi-relational pharmaceutical data by extending the TransE model with Python.
The TransE and STransE models represent relationships between head and tail entities as translations in embedding space.

In this project, I built a custom model based on the newer STransE model by extending the TransE model available on PyKeen. I then evaluated the perfomances of both models on the PharmKG dataset, a dataset on pharmaceutical data.

Refer to the report for more details.
